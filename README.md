### Understanding the Kernelization Process

Through this tool, Users can intuitively see how the kernelization process gradually simplifies a graph, and how this process affects the complexity of solving the problem. For the vertex cover problem, students can observe how different simplification rules are applied and how they gradually reduce the number of vertices and edges in the graph.

### Exploring the Impact of Parameters

Users can generate different graph instances by adjusting the number of vertices and sparsity parameters. This helps them understand how these graph characteristics affect the kernelization process and the final outcome.
